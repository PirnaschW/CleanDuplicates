# CleanDuplicates
Find Duplicates files in structures (by their content), and clean them up

Triggered by the mess of photos after a vacation, where pictures from many different phones and cameras are copied together,
the need for an **Identification Tool for Duplicate Files** arose.
This tool is supposed to analyze _all_ files within one or more directory trees, and find duplicate **content** files -
files that are named whatever and located anywhere, but have _exact identical content_.
It is then possible to delete one or more of the duplicates (or triplicates, etc.); resulting in unique content.
